        width configuration would fit in a line. Also it does *not* take any
        spacing into account.

        This algorithm prefers balanced column lengths over matching exactly
        `max_columns`. Only the last column is allowed to be shorter than the
        other columns. This means that you might encounter results which have a
        much fewer number of columns than you had requested. In consequence of
        this, two requests with different `max_columns` might return the same
        result.
